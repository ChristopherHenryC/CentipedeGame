Hello!
Compile and run "CentipedeMain" in a folder that has all the other java files and the two images provided. The file you unziped them in should work just fine.
When you run "CentipedeMain", the game should start running immediatly, make sure ship.png and shroom.jpg are in the same folder you run the game out of.
The game will create a new file containing difficulty settings after the first run, which will appear in the same folder the program is run out of.

I have included my slide deck in powerpoint and PDF format in the slide deck folder, and my javaDocs in the JavaDocs folder.

CONTROLS:
Left and Right arrow keys to move the spaceship left and right.

Spacebar to shoot lazers, if you shoot too quickly the ship will have to recharge, and you'll be unable to shoot.

Use the [P] key to Pause the game, and the [R] key to Resume playing. You can change the game difficulty with the options menu while paused.

RULES:

The centipede is trying to get you, it will snake through the mushrooms
Shoot mushrooms to destroy them, shoot the centipede to destroy segments.
When you shoot a segment, it becomes a mushroom, splitting into two new centipedes.
If you destroy every segment, you win! If the centipede reaches you, its game over.

After you win or lose, just close the program and run it again to restart, and you'll have a new randomly generated forest of mushrooms.
If you close the program using Exit in the options menu, you will start on the same difficulty when you run it again.

OPTIONS:
Click on the options menu to bring up buttons to change difficulty, or exit the game.
Hard: Change the centipede to blue, he'll now move faster, but so you will you!
Easy: Change the centipede to green, everything is slowed down so you have more time to react.
Normal: Return the centipede to red, everything will return to regular speed. For the levelheaded player.
Exit: Save the difficulty you are playing on, and close the program.

Thanks for playing! -Chris Conway
